		<p>If you live an active life, then you probably know what it's like to strain, twist, or otherwise injure your back. Back injuries are very common and can impact every aspect of your life.</p>
		<p>The good news is that by doing the right kind of exercises, you can greatly reduce the risk of back injury. Following are a list of back strengthening exercises you can do at home to decrease your chances of injuring yourself.</p>
		<p><strong>1. Back Stretches.</strong> Stretching before exercises is one of the best ways to reduce the risk of injuries, so before you start to exercise, be sure to stretch.</p>
		<p><strong>2. Bridge.</strong> While lying on your back with your feet flat on the floor, raise your hips towards the ceiling and hold for three seconds. Repeat.</p>
		<p><strong>3. Bent-over Rows.</strong> Holding a pair of dumbbells in front of you, lean forward at the waist, being sure to keep your spine straight. Squeeze your back muscles and pull the weights up towards the sides of your chest. Slowly lower the weights and repeat.</p>
		<p><strong>4. Pull Ups</strong> If you're able to get your hands on a pull-up bar, this exercise will do wonders for increasing the strength in your back and arms. Can't do any pull-ups? No problem. Check out <a href="pullups.html">this article</a> for tips on how to build up to it.</p>
		<p><strong>5. Abdominal Crunches</strong> Wait a second! Isn't this article about back exercises? Why are we doing crunches? Well, strengthening your core is crucial for good lower-back support. Many back injuries are an indirect result of poorly developed core muscles. Strengthening your core will provide support and stability for your entire body.</p>
